# Machine-learning-with-R-
The aim of this exercise is to use several machine learning algorithms: Logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), KNN, naives bayes, random forest, in order to predict the quality of the wine for which we have some information.

The intruction are as follows

a) Divide the data into training and testing sets. Use 70% as the training set.
b) Using the India.csv data, (anemia2 being the target variable), fit the following models: Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na√Øve Bayes (NB) and
Logistic Regression (LR).
c) For each of the models, compute Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-
Score and Precision for each model.
d) Create a single table to summarize your results in (c) above.
e) Write a paragraph to explain what your preferred model is and give the reasons for
your choice.
